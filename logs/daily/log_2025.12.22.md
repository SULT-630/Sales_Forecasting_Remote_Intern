# Daily Log — 2025-12-22

## Objective
- Adjust the evaluator to use MAPE index
- Adjust the processor to split the data according to time sequence
- Add spatial decomposition function
- Run models with spatial decomposition or time encoding
- Rerun the three models tested on 2025.12.21
- Rolling predict
- Complete part of the weekly report

## Works done
- Add MAPE evaluation
- Time sequence split
- Above functions tested
- Feature engineering and spatial encoding, many featured added

## Key Findings

## Issues Encountered

## How Issues Were Resolved
- 鉴于模型要学习时序特征，那就不建议把数据集分成几份做k-fold了，可能会损失时序特征
- 价格方面的lag还不清楚要怎么做，暂时搁置了
## Problems

## Next Steps
