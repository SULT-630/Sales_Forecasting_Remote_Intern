## Objective
- Complete EDA on the dataset
- Structure cleaning
- Type and Semantics check
- Deal with missing value
- Deal with repeated value
- Deal with outliers (include incorrect and trend-related outliers)
- Basic analysis and visualization
- Trend detection ()

## Work Done
- Data shape and structure
- Data transformation and semantic check
- Feature of is_discount_sku and discount_ratio added
- Missing value and ratio (pattern)
- Repeated value
- Univariate analysis (distribution and cardinality)
- V.s target variable (relationship with y and y's distribution regarding different classes)
- correlation, 明显共线性， 要不要做降维
- Outliers 有模式的/明显错误的

## Key Findings
- dtype of week, store id, sku id, is featured sku and is display sku need to be transformed 
- Only one missing value occur in the col of total price, thus we decide to directly delete it
- During semantics check, we found that all constraints wrriten in schema are fitted while there're 2.26% of the cases where total price is larger than base price
- No repeated rows detected

## Issues Encountered


## How Issues Were Resolved


## Problems


## Next Steps
- Decide how to solve the cases where total price > base price
