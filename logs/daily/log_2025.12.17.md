## Objective
- Complete EDA on the dataset
- Structure cleaning
- Type and Semantics check
- Deal with missing value
- Deal with repeated value
- Deal with outliers (include incorrect and trend-related outliers)
- Basic analysis and visualization
- Trend detection ()

## Work Done
- Data shape and structure
- Data transformation and semantic check
- Feature of is_discount_sku and discount_ratio added
- Missing value and ratio (pattern)
- Repeated value
- Univariate analysis (distribution and cardinality)
- V.s target variable (relationship with y and y's distribution regarding different classes)
- correlation, 明显共线性， 要不要做降维
- Outliers 有模式的/明显错误的

## Key Findings
- dtype of week, store id, sku id, is featured sku and is display sku need to be transformed 
- Only one missing value occur in the col of total price, thus we decide to directly delete it
- During semantics check, we found that all cols pass data quality assessment but, however,  there're 2.26% of the cases where total price is larger than base price
- No repeated rows detected
- For continuous numeric variable:
    - total price: 轻度右偏，波动较大，但对于价格的现实意义来说比较合理，建模时考虑log变换或者标准化
    - base price：右偏程度更高，离散结构和total price类似
    - discount ratio： 绝大部分商品没有折扣，不能单独当作连续变量考虑，而是与is_discount的flag一起考虑，只有当flag为1时才考虑折扣率
    - KDE曲线显示价格数据中有四个峰，可能代表有四个价格层级，未来建模中可以考虑分组分析

## Next Steps
- Decide how to solve the cases where total price > base price
